int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) return a;
  return gcd(b, a%b);
}

lcm of a,b = a * b / gcd(a,b);

we can use %lld in output answer

in case of prime number program definately use sqrt function

if we want to work on a long number of each digits. Then we can take that input string

If any program needs n prime numbers it it better to generate n prime numbers into any array before actual program


At Google, I asked a guy (born and raised in the US, native English speaker, etc) a question where the solution involved creating a mapping from each letter to how many times it appeared in a string. I asked him how big his array would be. (I do this to test whether he's thinking about lowercase and uppercase, all ASCII characters, etc.)

Considering all ASCII, 256, would be right.

Insteda of making initial values of zeros and to compare after just fix one value and compare with that value.

for caching concept in programming we can use array increment model

aobe two lines are from 14th program of eular project

converting lower case to upper case is lwr_chart=lwr_chart+'A'-'a';

int no_of_brck(int a,int b,int c,int d){
	switch(a);
	case b:
		return 1;
	case c:
		return 2;
	case d:
		return 3;
	default return 0;
}	//this will give error becase we are using case statements
//using b,c,d in return statements also give error
