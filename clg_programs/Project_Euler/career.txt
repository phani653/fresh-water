When I first read the comments for the Quake III Arena "Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm" and shared it with some of my older students, we all definitely had a good laugh. Long story short the algorithm uses some very clever and opaque math and bit manipulation to create an excellent initial guess for the solution before beginning Newton's method of determining square roots. Which is documented as:

i = * ( long * ) &y; // evil floating point bit level hacking

i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 ); // what the fuck?
