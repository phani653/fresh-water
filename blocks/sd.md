* Problem will occur if multiple programs are running on multiple computers via Network trying to achieve a single task
* The main challenge in distributed systems is: <b>Fault tolerance</b> -> The System as a whole should continue work, even when some parts are faulty.
* <b>Latency</b> -> Time till the message receives
* <b>Bandwidth</b> -> Data volume per unit time
* <b>Service-oriented Architecture/Microservices:</b> Splitting a large software application into multiple services(on multiple nodes) that communicate via RPC
* SLO (Service Level Objective):
    * ex: 99.9% of requests in a day get a response in 200 ms
* SLA (Service Level Agrrement):
    * Contract specifying some SLO, penalties for violation
 * Network Models - Reliable, Fair-loss or arbitrary
 * Node Models - Crash-stop, Crash-recovery or Byzantine
 * Time Models - Synchronous, Partially synchronous or Asynchronous
